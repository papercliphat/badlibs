      <p>    You will need to provide the URL and the GitHub repository for an interactive website that you have created by hand, and from scratch, that is live on the internet. By "interactive" we mean that it uses vanilla JavaScript (specifically event listeners) to process and store user input and subsequently display new content to the user. In addition, the user input and new content must remain retrievable/viewable after a screen refresh.</p>
