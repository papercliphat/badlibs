# **BADLIBS**

### Description

Badlibs is your place for one awful madlib. Designed to meet the requirements for testing into a class, a minimum amount of styling and data manipulation was used to maximize developer efficiency!

Created by Michael Porter to meet the requirements for the seattle-301d20 group at codefellows.

Designed on a napkin. (Napkin has since been used...)
